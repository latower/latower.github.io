I am an assistant professor at the [Algorithmics](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/software-technology/algorithmics) group of the [Department of Software Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/software-technology/) at the [Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/eemcs) at [Delft University of Technology](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/).

### My research

I specialise in Symbolic AI (mathematical logic-based reasoning). Even though we as a society put a lot of trust in AI, mainstream AI systems are essentially "just winging it". I care about create AI systems that _deserve_ our trust.

Real-world problem-solving typically involves reasoning about uncertain knowledge and uncertain future events. Well-informed decision-making hence requires us to take that uncertainty into account. Precisely because the world is uncertain enough by itself, it is important that we can _trust_ the AI systems that aid us in our decision-making. By designing our algorithms carefully ([LatEtAl22](/publication/2022-01-01-Exact-stochastic-constraint-optimisation-with-applications-in-network-analysis), [LatEtAl24b](/publication/2024-01-01-SharpVelvet)), we can create a reality in which AI can aid humans to make decisions ([LatEtAl23](/publication/2023-01-01-Solving-the-Identifying-Code-Set-Problem-with-Grouped-Independent-Support)) about uncertain events ([LatEtAl17](/publication/2017-01-01-Combining-Stochastic-Constraint-Optimization-and-Probabilistic-Programming--From-Knowledge-Compilation-to-Constraint-Solving), [LatEtAl19a](publication/2019-01-01-Stochastic-Constraint-Propagation-for-Mining-Probabilistic-Networks)), while providing _guarantees_ ([LatEtAl24a](/publication/2024-07-01-The-Cardinality-of-Identifying-Code-Sets-for-Soccer-Ball-Graph-with-Application-to-Remote-Sensing-preprint)) that the reasoning behind those decisions is correct.

### My background

Before joining TU Delft, I spent two years at the [Meel group](https://meelgroup.github.io), at the [School of Computing](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/) of the [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/), as a post-doctoral Research Fellow working under the supervision of [Prof. dr. Kuldeep Meel](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~meel/). Before that, I earned a doctorate degree from [Leiden University](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en), under the supervision of [Dr. Siegfried Nijssen](https://webperso.info.ucl.ac.be/~snijssen/), [Prof. dr. Holger Hoos](https://hoos.ca/main.html) and [Prof. dr. Joost Kok](https://www.tue.nl/en/research/researchers/joost-kok).

Over the last few years, I have spent time as a visiting researcher at [Universit√© catholique de Louvain](https://uclouvain.be/en/research-institutes/icteam/ingi), [University of Toronto](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/) (working with [Prof. dr. Fahiem Bacchus](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fbacchus/)) and the [Simons Institute at University of California, Berkeley](https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/extended-reunion-satisfiability).

### Want to work with me?

_I am currently looking for motivated MSc and BSc students_ with a solid background in algorithm design and logic, who would like to do their research project with me. Please contact me if you are interested, so we can discuss possible topics.
