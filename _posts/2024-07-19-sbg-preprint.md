I am happy to announce that my co-authors and I have released the preprint of our new paper: *The Cardinality of Identifying Code Sets for Soccer Ball Graph with Application to Remote Sensing*, available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14120).

Please check out the [related repository](https://github.com/latower/SBG-bounds/), and stay tuned for a blog post to explain what we've done!
