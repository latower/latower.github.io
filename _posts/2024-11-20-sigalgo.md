One week from now, on 27 November 2024, [I will present](https://latower.github.io/talks/2024-11-27-SIGAlgoNL) our [IJCAI 2023 paper](https://latower.github.io/publication/2023-01-01-Solving-the-Identifying-Code-Set-Problem-with-Grouped-Independent-Support) at the [inaugural symposium](https://www.sigalgo.nl/symposium/) of the new Special Interest Group for Algorithms ([SIGAlgo](https://www.sigalgo.nl/)). SIGAlgo is part of IPN, the [ICT-Research Platform Netherlands](https://ict-research.nl), and focuses on fundamental, applied and complexity-oriented research on algorithms.
