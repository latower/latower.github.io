Today, ir. Andrei "Andrew" Mereu≈£a successfully defended his MSc thesis: [Multi-Meal, Multi-Constraint Recommender System to Optimize Grocery Budget and Waste](https://repository.tudelft.nl/record/uuid:b524f5bc-c283-4fa3-9906-4d5f4899d0e5). Many congratulations to him for reaching this milestone!

Andrei was kindly hosted by [Picnic](https://picnic.app), under the supervision of Catalin Stefan Cernat. My colleague [dr. Neil Yorke-Smith](https://www.tudelft.nl/ewi/over-de-faculteit/afdelingen/software-technology/algorithmics/people/neil-yorke-smith) and I had the pleasure of co-supervising him on behalf of the Algorithmics group of TU Delft.

Andrei worked on Picnic's meal planner service. His goal was to help consumers minimise costs by selecting a weekly menu in which dishes share ingredients, so consumers can buy in bulk. A secondary goal was to select recipes, ingredients and corresponding packing that minimises the waste that comes from unused ingredients.

To this end, Andrei did a thorough study of integer-linear programming (ILP) and genetic algorithm (GA) methods, and hybrid ILP-GA methods to see how fast they are and how well they achieve both optimisation criteria. He showcased his ability to come up with practical tools that are a good starting point for actual potential integration in real systems.

For me, this was a great opportunity to learn more about how Industry operates. Never before were my YouTube videos interrupted by commercials for a product that I was (however peripherally) involved in developing. I wish Andrei all the best for his next career steps!
