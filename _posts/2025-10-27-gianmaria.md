Welcome to my first Honours Student: [Gianmaria Piergianni](https://gianmariapiergianni.com)!

## The TU Delft Honours Programme
At Delft University of Technology, our top BSc students can apply to the Honours programme. During the 2-year programme, an Honours student will spend 15 ECTS working with a faculty member to do an original piece of research, culminating in a report, a presentation, and ideally also a publication. For more information, see [this website](https://www.tudelft.nl/studenten/ewi-studentenportal/onderwijs/honours-programme).

## The project
In the coming two years, Gianmaria will be working on algorithms for optimal computer network monitoring system design. In doing so, he will build on [my earlier work](/posts/2023/06/gismo/) on this topic, as well as on work by my former colleagues from Université catholique de Louvain (e.g., [[BSP2024](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-60597-0_11)]).

I trust that the combination of hard-core formal methods and some challenging programming tasks are well-suited for someone like Gianmaria, who enjoys picking apart complex puzzles, so he can understand every detail. The approach we are taking is related to the work that I will start shortly for my [Veni project](/posts/2025/07/veni/), so I am keen to see what we can achieve. I am excited to have Gianmaria on board and I am looking forward to a fruitful collaboration.
