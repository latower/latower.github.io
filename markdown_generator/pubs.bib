      abstract = "In the context of satellite monitoring of the earth, we can assume that the surface of the earth is divided into a set of regions. We assume that the impact of a big social/environmental event spills into neighboring regions. Using Identifying Code Sets (ICSes), we can deploy sensors in such a way that the region in which an event takes place can be uniquely identified, even with fewer sensors than regions. As Earth is almost a sphere, we use a soccer ball as a model. We construct a Soccer Ball Graph (SBG), and provide human-oriented, analytical proofs that 1) the SBG has at least 26 ICSes of cardinality ten, implying that there are at least 26 different ways to deploy ten satellites to monitor the Earth and 2) that the cardinality of the minimum Identifying Code Set (MICS) for the SBG is at least nine. We then provide a machine-oriented formal proof that the cardinality of the MICS for the SBG is in fact ten, meaning that one must deploy at least ten satellites to monitor the Earth in the SBG model. We also provide machine-oriented proof that there are exactly 26 ICSes of cardinality ten for the SBG.",

abstract = "We present an extensive study of methods for exactly solving stochastic constraint (optimisation) problems (SCPs) in network analysis. These problems are prevalent in science, governance and industry. The first method we study is generic and decomposes stochastic constraints into a multitude of smaller local constraints that are solved using a constraint programming (CP) or mixed-integer programming (MIP) solver. However, many SCPs are formulated on probability distributions with a monotonic property, meaning that adding a positive decision to a partial solution to the problem cannot cause a decrease in solution quality. The second method is specifically designed for solving global stochastic constraints on monotonic probability distributions (SCMDs) in CP. Both methods use knowledge compilation to obtain a decision diagram encoding of the relevant probability distributions, where we focus on ordered binary decision diagrams (OBDDs). We discuss theoretical advantages and disadvantages of these methods and evaluate them experimentally. We observed that global approaches to solving SCMDs outperform decomposition approaches from CP, and perform complementarily to MIP-based decomposition approaches, while scaling much more favourably with instance size. Both methods have many alternative design choices, as both knowledge compilation and constraint solvers are used in a single pipeline. To identify which configurations work best, we apply programming by optimisation. Specifically, we show how an automated algorithm configurator can be used to find optimised configurations of our pipeline. After configuration, our global SCMD solving pipeline outperforms its closest competitor (a MIP-based decomposition pipeline) on all test sets we considered by up to two orders of magnitude in terms of PAR10 scores."
